        <p id="top">Non-Western formulations of cunning have the potential to challenge how oppressors view the suffering subject and systems of oppression in which she suffers. The sphere of social reproduction hands down feminine craftiness as the tactics of the oppressed, used righteously and compassionately in pursuit of safety and self-determination (Fortunati, 2015). The clever storyteller Scheherazade enacts this, volunteering to marry a king who married a new virgin each night only to behead her the next morning; each night, she craftily postpones her execution by starting to tell an engrossing tale whose conclusion spills into the next night, for 1,001 nights, until the king falls in love with her and spares her life. Embodied cunning is pedagogical, attempting to inculcate in the oppressor empathy for the Other and a sense of justice. A woman like Scheherazade illustrates the cunning use of storying, humor, and a combination of obliqueness and explicitness in pursuit of this aim. A woman like <span lang="ta">Kannagi</span>, coupled tightly with justice and self-righteous anger, demonstrates the destructive potential of harnessing tragedy to speak truth to power.</p>
        <p>It's not lost on me that I'm doing this as well: telling the same story repeatedly, with tightly controlled antagonism, to survive in the clinic and academy.</p>
        <p>The predominant ancient Greek conceptualization of <span lang="grc">metis</span> doesn't touch on morality or minor affects, which Ngai (2005) describes as weak negative emotions, like envy, irritation, indignation, or anxiety, or the equivocal despair and gratification of a Pyrrhic victory, a metaphorical suicide bombing. Ngai contends that irritation, a minor affect, is diffuse, unlocalizable, racially marked, and written in the psyche and epidermis, part of the fascial organ (pp. 2-3, 182-183). Fibromyalgic fascia dries and sticks with irritation that deforms the tissues while demanding a corporeal response. Ngai argues that ostensibly undesirable affects are desirable for political resistance. As irritation is my normal, the fascial position-state I cunningly contend with and use, its resistive potential is encoded in my every movement and restriction.</p>
        <p>As Ahmed (2017) says, "Irritation registers contact as intrusion. . . . The quality of an experience is that of rubbing up against something other than yourself, but once you are rubbed up the wrong way, it can feel like your own body is against you, even in those moments of relief" (Ahmed, 2017, p. 190).</p>
        <p>Aristotle calls the unirascible "fools" (Ngai, 2005, p. 183), implying that irascibility is central to cunning.</p>

        <p>Homeric stories about <span lang="grc">metis</span>, such as Antilochus' race or Odysseus' many wily exploits, are seemingly void of morality, unlike the <span lang="grc">metis</span> of Hesiod's <i>Theogony</i>. Faraone and Teeter (2004) argue that the fragments of Hesiod and Chrysippus, whom Detienne and Vernant's (1978/1991) elide, present a <span lang="grc">Metis</span> closely aligned with the Egyptian goddess <span lang="ar">Maat</span>. <span lang="ar">Maat</span> is also swallowed, used to legitimize (male) monarchic rule due to her association with cunning, justice, and righteousness (pp. 178-179). In ancient Egypt, <span lang="ar">maat</span> was both "the abstract concept of truth and correctness in the cosmic and social spheres and [the] anthropomorphic form [of] a goddess (<span lang="ar">Maat</span>) who personifies truth and order" (p. 186). Often incorporated into the coronation names of kings to designate them wise and righteous, <span lang="ar">Maat</span> was designated the "author of justice" and the representative of the moral, social, and legal order (pp. 187, 202). Influenced by <span lang="ar">maat</span>, Hesiod stresses that Zeus' <span lang="grc">metis</span> is not "crooked" like his father Kronos' because Zeus preserves <span lang="grc">Metis</span> in his <span lang="grc">nēdús</span>, the divine receptive, reproductive cavity and source of his violent impulses, where her moral authority can curb his immoral desire (p. 206).</p>
        <p>Raphals' (1992) study of cunning intelligence in the classical Chinese tradition (<i><span lang="zh">zhi</span></i>) is propelled by the notion that Detienne and Vernant (1978/1991) identify <span lang="grc">metis</span> as a universal mode of intelligence, so it should be evident in other cultural traditions and languages. <span lang="zh">Zhi</span>, or "to know," has a "semantic span from wise counsel and foresight to deception and craft" (p. 13). It is often gendered, laudatory when applied to a man but critical in relation to a woman, with the exception of the Buddhist <span lang="zh">Guan Yin</span> in <i>Journey to the West</i> and <span lang="zh">Zhuge Liang's</span> shrewd wife <span lang="zh">Huang Yueying</span> in <i>Romance of the Three Kingdoms</i>. <span lang="zh">Zhi</span> is often assessed in oracular terms, as the foolish man is mystified by present circumstances, but the wise man can perceive what has not yet happened. <span lang="zh">Zhi</span> is also discursive: that is, the wise man understands what he perceives and knows how to articulate it (p. 21). In this sense, <span lang="zh">zhi</span> is founded on the "belief [that] there is a correspondence between language and reality, that language can express the actual relationship between words and things" (p. 30)</p>

        <p>Raphals (1992) traces the relationship between ethics, language, and <span lang="zh">zhi</span> in multiple schools of early Chinese thought. Early conceptions of <span lang="zh">zhi</span> were likely amoral and ambivalent, but post-Confucian <span lang="zh">zhi</span> acquires an ethical outlook and accords with codified rules, while "crooked" or "mere cleverness" is degeneracy (p. 38). Classical Confucianism accepts cunning intelligence but considers some of its expressions, like "merely clever" language, to be underhanded conduct. The Mohist canon positively associates cunning with practical know-how, connoting talent and capability, clear vision, forethought, planning, skill. As a departure from Confucianism, craft was recast as skill instead of trickery, and skill constituted "real knowledge," the "ability to respond immediately, effectively, and it would appear, intuitively to rapidly changing situations" (p. 69), much like <span lang="grc">metis</span>. Finally, the extralinguistic intelligence that Taoists describe parallels <span lang="grc">metis</span> (p. 70). For philosophers like <span lang="zh">Laozi</span>, there is no distinction between virtuous and vicious cunning, dispensing with the ethical tension between wisdom and cunning, allowing a description of cunning that isn't dichotomous.</p>
        <p>Each school rejects cunning as an aspect of true wisdom but perceives it as acceptable and necessary in the martial sphere. The Chinese strategist-general represents a shift to an intellectual rather than a heroic view of military affairs, but it remains concerned with the transmission of texts as a means to knowledge and power (Raphals, 1992, pp. 101-103). This focus on the intellectual nature of warfare leads to the disparagement of unnecessary force or violence. In military treatises, <span lang="zh">zhi</span> is value-neutral, while Confucian tracts use moral terminology, and literary accounts like the <i>Romance</i> combine the two. The resulting philosophical and semantic contrast echoes the repeated, cross-cultural contrast between "heroes of force" and "heroes of guile" that implicitly interrogates the linkage between honor and (moral) straightforwardness and craftiness and (amoral) illusion.</p>
        <p>Cross-culturally, the heroic agon is deeply concerned with cunning, as it is with social order and the relationship between wisdom and ethical outlook. Where Homeric <span lang="grc">metis</span> is wisdom apart from whether its employment is righteous, Hesiodic <span lang="grc">metis</span> and post-Confucian <span lang="zh">zhi</span> both position wisdom in relation to justice, virtuousness, and legitimate, absolutized sovereignty and in opposition to underhanded deceit.</p>
        <p>The Sanskrit term <span lang="sa">upaya-kausalya</span> couples expedient means with cleverness, resulting in <i>skill in means</i>: a pedagogical concept and a set of practices that aid individuals in attaining Enlightenment. As an action that is expedient and cunning, it is <span lang="grc">kairotic, phronetic, metic</span>, applied with compassion, and permitted to deviate from Buddhist doctrine in acknowledgment of the fact that teachings are meant to be orientating, not absolute. <span lang="sa">Upaya-kausalya</span> belongs to the constellation of cunning as conceptualized in the ancient world, but to the principle of justice it adds empathy (Detienne & Vernant, 1978/1991; Faraone & Teeter, 2004; Raphals, 1992). In explicitly restoring this dimension of care to cunning as practice and pedagogy, <span lang="sa">upaya-kausalya</span> automatically associates itself with the righteous decision.</p>
        <p>This survey of cunning intelligence in the ancient world helps me think through <span lang="ta">thanthiram</span>, which isn't as heavily theorized through literary or historical accounts. The argument could perhaps be made that <span lang="ta">thanthiram</span>, the ability to see through the illusion or trick, couples wisdom with righteousness, as when <span lang="sa">Karna</span> understands it is <span lang="sa">Indra</span> to whom he is giving his armor but is generous, and with irritability, as when <span lang="sa">Vishvamitra</span> recognizes <span lang="sa">Indra's</span> tricks and reacts with rage &mdash; foolishly undoing the fruits of his long meditation. The person with <span lang="ta">thanthiram</span> relies on not only crafty language and storytelling, but also the fascial position-states encouraged by her own storytelling disposition, which may embody compassion, humor, courage, anxiety, or frustration. Like <span lang="ar">Maat</span> and the "person of '<span lang="zh">zhi</span>,'" she learns to orient herself and her flesh for the straightforward attainment of just ends. Fibromyalgic cunning, in search of empathy from care providers or personal justice, instinctively employs "skill in means" to habituate fascial position-states that bring her closer to these aims.</p>
        <p><span lang="ta">Thanthiram</span> or <span lang="sa">upaya-kausalya</span> injects a sense of homeland-based community, minor affects, and anger into my specific fibromyalgic fascial cunning. Irritability often accompanies post-traumatic stress and the experience of chronic painervation. There is an envy of those who reside on the soil most compatible with their substance, implicit in Daniel's (1984) ethnography of Tamil Nadu when his informants who are <span lang="ta">Vellalar</span>-caste Tamils claim that they possess great "<span lang="ta">tantirakkunam</span>" (a word that shares a root with <span lang="ta">thanthiram</span>), the crafty, cunning disposition required to be a successful businessmen or politician; but up-country Tamils who settle on Sinhala soil are affected by its substance and, disequilibrated, become "<span lang="ta">kenakkunam</span>," or gullible, their crafty orientation not gone but displaced, muffled (pp. 93-94).</p>
        <p><span lang="ta">Thanthiram</span> is both value-neutral &mdash; artful, crafty, wily &mdash; and negative &mdash; the underhanded (if amusing) trick &mdash; and community-defining &mdash; Tamil. It is the wisdom of the fish in the <span lang="sa">Panchatantra</span> story just as it, unlike other conceptualizations of cunning, is tightly coupled with irascibility, a stereotypical trait of the South Asian sage.</p>
        <p>A Ph.D. candidate and professor, I am a learned Tamil woman. I like to think my gut and fascia have acquired the choleric temper of the wise sage <span lang="ta">Vishvamitra</span>, whose fits of anger comprised some of my favorite stories as a child. He meditated so intensely he frightened the gods, but he was often easily angered into breaking his penance, expending energy earned through years of austerities and maintaining perfect equilibrium on a single curse. It feels close to life with chronic pain.</p>
        <p>If the unirascible woman is a fool, the irascible sage is cunning for her ability to reformulate her fascia and the fascia of her oppressors with her irritation and frustration. It brings to mind a peer who told me that taking medication is a sign of weakness, to which I felt my entire soft supportive skeleton rise to the shoulders and drop everywhere else, and my face, my voice when I said "Oh?," conveyed the minor affects my flesh was communicating. Or a physical therapist who commented while manipulating my right leg that I didn't look like the movement hurt me, and I bit back irascible words, but the instinctive irascible reformulation of the flesh stiffened my leg while he had it in his hands, its sudden immobility shocking him.</p>
        <p>The biological substrata of the disabled multitude grants us a shared capacity to unintentionally shock, because fascially, enterically, the bodymind acts. Gut negativity, as in merycism in infants or irritable bowel syndrome in fibromyalgic patients, is directed at relations of care, damaging and damaged by that to which it is attached. How many of us, organized into a crip commons around a fibromyalgic microbiome (which already influences our social lives just as our social bonds influence our microbiomes), hate our ableist environments, hate the side-effects of our medications, hate masquerading, hate disclosing, hate tirelessly self-advocating, hate the clinic, the academy, the bodymind that we simultaneously love and want to live? Like Medea's <span lang="grc">metis</span>, "the gut devours and rejects and reincorporates; it damages and attempts repair and thrives on its revenge" (Wilson, 2015, pp. 82-83), acknowledging what so many people can't bring themselves to admit: that negativity is politically salient and socially bonding (Cvetkovich, 2012; Wilson, 2015; Ngai, 2005).</p>
        <p>Like trickster figures and fascia, these South Asian sages are not indomitable or flawless. Their slips of anger are fuck-ups that can't be undone and must be mitigated every time. To use a Eurocentric example, this is akin to the Norse trickster Loki, divine irritant of the <span lang="no">Aesir</span>. In Norse myth, the relationship between cunning and legitimate sovereignty is even more firmly established, but the figures who represent each move in and out of ambivalence, and sovereignty itself cannot be absolute given the cyclical nature of time (Wanner, 2009, p. 213). Odin is cunning, far-seeing, and wise, portrayed as a legitimate, absolute, but precarious ruler, protecting a precarious order: "all victories are tactical and temporary, serving perhaps to stave off but never to thwart the inevitability of <span lang="no"><i>ragnarök</i></span>, the 'doom of the gods,' in which both god and world order will meet their end" (p. 221).</p>
        <p>Loki and Odin both possess <span lang="grc">metic</span> intelligence, representing the conflict between moral and amoral cunning, illegitimate power and sovereign authority. Wanner (2009) contends that the disparity between the two gods is not exactly moral in nature, as Odin's cunning is slightly moralized but shares the semantic field of Loki's cunning. Loki is crafty, wicked, calamitous, polymorphic, while Odin is wise, knowledgeable, a master of disguise; both frequently confront opponents stronger than themselves, relying on <span lang="grc">polumetis</span> (infinite wiles) and <span lang="grc">kairos</span> (the opportune moment); both are masculine figures with feminine dimensions, due to sex changes or the "unmanly" practice of magic (pp. 221-222). Both engage in <span lang="no">flyting</span>, the dialectic of insults where victory is founded on clever wordsmithing, though the former does so with Thor and the latter with all of the <span lang="no">Aesir</span>.</p>
        <p>Loki is a change-agent, spitefully engineering the beloved <span lang="no">Baldr's</span> death as a demonstration that control is never comprehensive: there is always an exploit to be found, however violent its exercise. Also, and importantly for misability and the fuck-ups of fibromyalgic fascial cunning, Loki is too clever for his own good. Many tricksters, like Coyote, Raven, and Hermes, create snares for food or pleasure. In his flight from <span lang="no">Asgard after Baldr's</span> death, Loki crafts the fishnet to imagine how the <span lang="no">Aesir</span> might catch him and how he might break free. However, he is interrupted in this pursuit by the other gods, so he casts the net on the campfire, transforms into a salmon, and leaps into the river. <span lang="no">Kvasir</span>, wisest of them all, spies the burning net, and the <span lang="no">Aesir</span> create a copy of it and use it to capture and bind Loki for good (Hyde, 2010, p. 18).</p>
        <p>Cross-culturally, this theme recurs: trickery undone by foolishness, impetuousness, or accident, caught in the snares of its own devising. <span lang="sa">Ravana</span> excluding humans from his list of potential threats. Antilochus' cheat exposed. <span lang="sa">Karna</span>, believing his introduction to <span lang="sa">Parasurama</span> is a lie because he is the son of a charioteer, not because he is (unknown to him) a <span lang="sa">kshatriya</span>, an accidental trap of his own making.</p>
        <p>This constellation of cunning, somatic intelligence includes in its semantic field justice, empathy, expedient pedagogy, feminine intuition, and innovation as well as the ugly feelings that contribute to the thickening, dehydrating, stiffening, and rearranging of fascia. Irritability, (knowing or unwitting) foolish action, and failure develop and decolonize dominant rhetorical conceptions of cunning.</p>
        <p>The reality for the chronically ill is that ugly feelings are elicited in us every day, due to ableism, healthcare management, pain, fatigue, and the culture of overwork. From a praxis-oriented perspective, fibromyalgic fascial cunning must be cross-cultural and kaleidoscopic to retain the qualities of the material existence of the pained Eelam Tamil American subject, as embodied existence is more complicated than an archetype. <a href="#top" class="fn">&#8617;</a></p>
