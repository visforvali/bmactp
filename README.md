# This is about the body, the mind, the academy, the clinic, time, and pain [DEMO]

This is a selection of excerpts from my digital dissertation, submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for a Ph.D. in Communication, Information, and Media from Rutgers University. The excerpts are largely dynamic content that could not be included in the print version submitted to the School of Graduate Studies.

## Description

* This project doubles as an exercise in using HTML5, Bootstrap, Python, and multimedia forms to simulate the experience of reading, writing, and surviving as an academic with fibromyalgia and myalgic encephalomyelitis. As the full digital dissertation has not been published yet, this selection doubles as a "demo" of the work and a book proposal for open-access digital publishing companies. As such, this site includes two "extras" that weren't a part of the dissertation before its final revision and deposit, such as a book proposal, a post-defense epilogue, and 404 "events."

### Dependencies

* These pages are primarily CSS, HTML5, Bootstrap, and a little JQuery. It is mobile responsive but best perused on a desktop with sound enabled. Windows XP or Mac PS X 10.6 or higher is required for the visual novel.

### Installing

* The only download necessary to experience this project is "There is a reason they call it a theater" in Adi Kandam. Windows XP or Mac PS X 10.6 or higher is required. If you are a Mac OS user, you may get a message stating that "the app cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified." To open the game, select Cancel rather then Move to Trash, then navigate to Security & Privacy/General and select the Open Anyway button next to the app's name. After downloading, extract the zip archive and launch the application in the main game folder.
