    <section>
      <p>A Tamil woman student passing under a tree hears a voice in her head: "Will you accept seven jars of gold?" The student looks around and sees no one, but the offer of gold arouses her avarice and suppresses her caution. She exclaims, "Yes, I accept!" At once the voice replies, "Then go home, for I have carried the jars to your house."</p>
      <p>The student hastens home to verify this declaration and finds the seven jars in her study. She opens them one by one. Each of the first six is filled to the brim with gold, but the last jar is only half-full. A strong desire arises in her mind to fill the last jar, for without it, her happiness is incomplete. She melts down her bangles and earrings and nose ring and converts her savings to gold and adds it all to the jar, but the mysterious vessel remains only half-full. Exasperated, she spends less and less, to the point of starving herself, adding all of her income to the jar, but the vessel remains as before. So one day, she humbly asks her guru for an increase to her stipend, and as she is a favorite student, as soon as her request is made, it is granted. She saves her pay and dumps into the jar, but still the jar shows no signs of filling.</p>
      <p>Dejected and obsessed, the student's condition worsens every day. Seeing her plight, her guru asks her, "<span lang="ta">Sishya!</span> When your pay was half of what you make now, you were happier and well fed! What is the matter with you? Have you got the seven jars?"</p>
      <p>Astonished, the student asks, "Guru, who has informed you of this?"</p>
      <p>Her guru replies, "Ah, don't you know that these are the signs of the <span lang="sa">Yaksha's</span> seven jars? He offered these jars to me also, but no sooner did I ask if these wages were to be spent or hoarded than he vanished with no reply. Don't you know you cannot spend this money? It only brings with it the desire for more. Go at once and return the jars."</p>
      <p>This advice brings the student to her senses. She returns to the tree and says, "O <span lang="sa">Yaksha</span>, take back your gold." The same voice as before replies: "It is done." When the student returns home, she finds the seven jars have disappeared as mysteriously as they arrived, and with it, her lifelong savings.</p>
      <p>I offer you two readings. In the first reading, so it is with the dimensions of settler colonialism. The gold in the jars is the valuable social status of white-affiliation deriving from the woman's classification as a quasi-assimilable South Asian model minority, a subordinate settler who benefits as long as she performs whiteness (Tuck & Yang, 2012, p. 18). The wealth she pours into the seventh jar is the Tamil cultural praxis she abandons in her greed for a whiter role to improve the odds of being believed in the clinic, for a whiter style of writing to improve her chances of completing her doctoral degree. She may be invited to be a white American settler, but as she will never be one, she is always in danger of reverting to foreign contagion. Pour as she might, she will never fill the seventh jar, and when the <span lang="sa">Yaksha</span> takes them back, her ethnic identity and cultural praxis go too.</p>
      <p>In the second reading, so it is with energy rationing in the chronically painervated patient. The jars are the alluring misconception that the more one hoards energy, the more energy one has to spend. But the truth is that energy is expended in the act of hoarding energy. Six of these jars present themselves as alluring energy reserves, while the seventh is an insurmountable energy sink: the dissertation, the 4/4 teaching load, service obligations, meetings, commutes, bodywork, intergenerational trauma, that prevent the woman from ever accessing the other six. Greedy for perpetual reserves of boundless energy if she can only fill the seventh jar, she forgets that <a href="../misability/balut.html" target="_blank">hoarded energy rots in the pocket</a>, and she spends the energy she has on a delusion. Thus, "those who do not understand the difference between what is real expenditure and what is real income lose all they have" (Sri Ramakrishna, 1947, p. 19).</p>

      <blockquote>
      the inability to see beyond the lack in the 7th jar belongs not just to the student. The guru understood himself to be incapable of overcoming a similar temptation and fate, and thus refused the offer. The lack here is not just in the jar, but in the imagination. A redistribution of the six jars to students while holding on to, or destroying, the 7th jar might have re-distributed the emptiness in a way that would minimize its allure. What makes it even worse for the guru is that he feels he has achieved something in the refusal and passes that along as a lesson.

      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
      It seems that the seventh jar is always enticing us to give more, whatever that might be. We will wage whatever it is that we have, whatever we are made of, to fulfill some arbitrary destiny. As with illusio, the game has been created: why seven? why not six full jars and marvel at the six, or share the six, or even contemplate the seventh's halfness. Isn't it all something to behold, whatever it is? But that is not the question on the tip of our tongue. It's WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO TO FILL THIS GODDAMN JAR??? The game survives on the illusion that it can be filled, it lights our brain up with the possibility of completion, of being SO CLOSE. To what, it doesn't matter, because we will give it all up to satisfy the urge.

      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        the student-patient realizes that the process of hoarding and desiring the jars and having to give them away is cyclical and that makes a big difference in how the jars are being valued or disvalued; then decides to abandon herself to the process until able to extract from energy economy altogether
