    <section>
      <p>King <span lang="sa">Yudhisthira</span> asks the foremost of orators, the sage <span lang="sa">Narada</span>, to narrate what he knows of the <span lang="sa">Pandavas'</span> half-brother <span lang="sa">Karna</span>, demigod son of <span lang="sa">Kunti</span> and <span lang="sa">Surya</span>, believed to be the son of the charioteer <span lang="sa">Adiratha</span> and his wife <span lang="sa">Radha</span>, killed by <span lang="sa">Arjuna</span> in the <span lang="sa">Kurukshetra</span> War. So questioned, the illustrious <span lang="sa">Narada</span> relates the curses and tricks that dictated the course of <span lang="sa">Karna's</span> life thus:</p>
      <p>"O mighty one, nothing on earth could best <span lang="sa">Karna</span> and <span lang="sa">Arjuna</span> in battle! Here is how that accomplished warrior <span lang="sa">Karna</span> came to be slain by your brother <span lang="sa">Arjuna's</span> hand. Your half-brother <span lang="sa">Karna</span> was conceived by <span lang="sa">Kunti</span> in her maidenhood, for she had invoked the sun-god <span lang="sa">Surya</span> out of curiosity and out of wedlock to fulfill a boon by which gods would sire her children. The boy born of this union was destined to be righteous and respectful, imbued with great energy, capable of inciting a war. <span lang="sa">Kunti</span> abandoned him to the river, which brought him to a charioteer of <span lang="sa">Hastinapur, Adiratha</span>, who adopted him, and so <span lang="sa">Karna</span> was believed to be a <span lang="sa">suta's</span> son. Close to the king's court as <span lang="sa">Adiratha's</span> son, <span lang="sa">Karna</span> learned the science of <span lang="sa">astras</span> and missiles from the preceptor <span lang="sa">Drona</span>, superior master of all weapons. One day he approached <span lang="sa">Drona</span> and humbly asked, 'I desire to know the <span lang="sa">Brahmastra</span>, with all its mantras and how to recant it, for I desire to be regarded as one accomplished in all weapons!' His <span lang="sa">kshatriya</span> blood, though he knew it not, urged him to make such a request. <span lang="sa">Drona</span>, partial to <span lang="sa">Arjuna</span> and unaware of <span lang="sa">Karna's</span> birthright, replied, 'None but a Brahmin who has duly made and observed all vows, or a <span lang="sa">kshatriya</span> who has practiced austere penances may learn the <span lang="sa">Brahmastra</span>.'"</p>
      <p>In some versions, <span lang="sa">Drona</span> laughs at him, like <span lang="sa">Draupadi</span> later laughs when <span lang="sa">Karna</span> asks to participate in the archery contest that will determine her betrothed, because he does not belong to the social class able to take up arms.</p>
      <p>You can also substitute <i>one expected to endure the pain of battle</i> every time the word <i>kshatriya</i> is uttered or, more simply, <i>one expected to endure pain</i>.
      <p><span lang="sa">Narada</span> continues, "So it is that <span lang="sa">Drona</span> thus answers, and <span lang="sa">Karna</span> respectfully departs and seeks out one who will teach him. He goes to the <span lang="sa">Mahendra</span> mountains to see the venerable <span lang="sa">Parashurama</span>, the sixth avatar of <span lang="sa">Vishnu</span>, born as a Brahmin but possessed of the traits of a <span lang="sa">kshatriya</span> despite his hatred of <span lang="sa">kshatriyas</span>. <span lang="sa">Karna</span> approached him and said, 'O Master, my name is <span lang="sa">Karna</span> and I am a Brahmin with ancestry to <span lang="sa">Bhrigu</span> who seeks knowledge of the <span lang="sa">Brahmastra</span>.' Hearing this lineage, <span lang="sa">Parashurama</span> accepted him as a pupil, saying, 'Thou art welcome!' <span lang="sa">Karna</span> resided in the <span lang="sa">Mahendra</span> mountains with his guru for years, acquiring knowledge of all the weapons and mingling with <span lang="sa">Gandharvas, Yakshas</span>, and gods. He became a great favorite of all who encountered him. One day, armed with sword and bow, he roamed the forest hunting, and perceiving movement, shot his arrow, which struck and killed the holy cow of a devotee of Brahma. Inadvertent though the act was, virtuous <span lang="sa">Karna</span> was guilt-stricken and sought out this devotee and confessed to the killing, prostrating himself in apology. But the devotee was furious and declared, 'O wicked one! As you struck down a helpless creature, so you deserve to be similarly killed. While fighting the one against whom you are destined to struggle, the earth will swallow your chariot wheel; and while you fruitlessly set your shoulder to it to regain the ability to move, your foe will demonstrate his prowess and behead you.' Though cursed, <span lang="sa">Karna</span> offered wealth and food to attempt to make amends, but all this was rejected. Cheerless, <span lang="sa">Karna</span> returned to <span lang="sa">Parashurama's</span> home, reflecting on this fate. Destiny is unwavering, so it is that this may have been his <span lang="ta">thalaiyeluththu</span>, the fate written on his head, at the moment of his birth.</p>
      <p><span lang="sa">Parashurama</span>, though, was well pleased with <span lang="sa">Karna's</span> progress, his affection, his discipline and self-restraint, and his desire to serve his preceptor, and so he highly favored him. After <span lang="sa">Karna</span> had observed ascetic penances, <span lang="sa">Parashurama</span> taught him of the <span lang="sa">Brahmastra</span>, after which, imbued with significant prowess, he devoted himself to the study of weapons and the arts of war. One day, intelligent and devout <span lang="sa">Parashurama</span>, while roving near the hermitage with <span lang="sa">Karna</span>, grew weak from all the fasts he had undergone. 'Let us rest,' <span lang="sa">Karna</span> suggested, seating himself under a tree, and with the affection of a guru to a trusted student, <span lang="sa">Parashurama</span> placed his head on <span lang="sa">Karna's</span> lap and soundly slept. As he slept, a frightful insect that fed on human fat and blood alighted on <span lang="sa">Karna's</span> thigh and began to tunnel into his flesh with its teeth. Not wanting to disturb his master's much-needed rest, <span lang="sa">Karna</span> gritted his teeth and held still. Though it gored through the skin, O <span lang="sa">Yudhisthira</span>, so the son of <span lang="sa">Surya</span>, lest any movement wake his guru, endured with heroic patience, without manifesting any sign of pain. However, his blood welled up in the wound and dripped onto <span lang="sa">Parashurama's</span> head, waking him. 'Alas, I have been made impure! My student, tell me how this has come to pass!' the great sage exclaimed. Stoically maintaining composure, <span lang="sa">Karna</span> gestured at the insect half-submerged in the flesh of his thigh. <span lang="sa">Parashurama</span> glanced at it, and instantly the creature expired, and before them, a <span lang="sa">rakshasa</span> appeared, dark in hue with a red face and neck; its hands joined, the demon declared, 'O best of ascetics, you have saved me from this curse. Formerly I was a great <span lang="sa">Asura</span>, but I ravished the wife of a great and holy sage in thy ancestry. In anger, that sage said unto me, 'You wretch, you will subsist on human fat and blood as a worm with an uncleansed soul until an ascetic of my race breaks this curse. You have done me great good today, and I adore you.' So saying, the <span lang="sa">Asura</span>, restored to his former state, bowed his head and vanished.</p>

      <p>"But <span lang="sa">Parashurama</span> had not forgotten his pupil's wound and on inspection saw how deep the tunnel, how minced the skin and flesh at the site, and he looked on <span lang="sa">Karna's</span> face, which bore no grimace or trace of tears. He addressed <span lang="sa">Karna</span> wrathfully, 'O you wretched fool, you sit with the patience of a <span lang="sa">kshatriya</span>. No Brahmin could have borne such pain. Who are you, and speak truthfully!' Fearing <span lang="sa">Parashurama</span> would curse him, and perhaps himself confused by the comparison to <span lang="sa">kshatriyas, Karna</span> prostrated himself and joined his hands together and answered, 'I am called <span lang="sa">Karna, the suta son of Adiratha and Radha</span>. I acted out of desire to obtain and master weapons, and as one's guru is akin to one's father, for this reason, I introduced myself as a member of your race.' To this, <span lang="sa">Parashurama</span> uttered, 'Since you have lied to obtain and master these weapons, and since you are not a Brahmin, know that the <span lang="sa">Brahmastra</span> will not dwell in your memory when you are matched with an opponent who is equal to you! Go now, for this is no place for those who speak falsely!' And so, O scion of <span lang="sa">Pandu's</span> race, your half-brother <span lang="sa">Karna</span> received the two curses that initiated his downfall."</p>
      <p>And so, the grand sage <span lang="sa">Narada</span> concluded the tale, and King <span lang="sa">Yudhisthira</span> braced his forehead in his hands and wept for the older brother he never knew.</p>

      <p>It would be more fitting if it was a story about a woman, for despite his low social status and even though the very gods stood arrayed against him, <span lang="sa">Karna</span> is a man, his pain therefore more acceptable than a woman's. Nevertheless, this is the first mythological blueprint I encounter that unites unusual pain tolerance; brain fog whose occurrence is foreseen but whose timing is uncertain; a kind of unwitting disability masquerade; and the need to accept your fate even while contesting it. <span lang="sa">Karna</span> is not disabled; his pain tolerance is a skill, simply one that did not belong in his training, assessment, and pretenses. O vaunted readers, see how it's my story I'm telling here, told to me by <span lang="ta">Appa</span> when I was young, before we were prescient enough to know its daunting relevance to our lives. Tucked safely in bed, I understand that appearing to be other than what you are is punishable, stoicism only protects you until you bleed, and an exposed pain threshold, whatever its uses, is condemnable.</p>
      <p>Decades later, with a wildly erratic pain threshold and a perforated appendix, I make <span lang="sa">Karna's</span> mistake: I tolerate pain like a <span lang="sa">kshatriya</span> warrior when I profess to be of a class that can't. The textbook presentation of appendicitis for ableds, as it's sold to me, is visibly excruciating pain, incoherence, a hampered gait; the expected presentation of fibromyalgia, a pain amplification syndrome, is also visibly excruciating pain.</p>
      <p>No one expects pain to look painless, least of all when it is amplified. Like <span lang="sa">Karna</span>, enacting this in spaces of education and assessment swallows my chariot wheel and sets against me the very gods, the final arbiters of my professional and medical value.</p>
