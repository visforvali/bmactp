        <p>what better way to learn that learning is marked by violence?</p>
        <p>language is another instrument of violence. my pediatrician, smug in her monolingual, monocultural habitus,<br>

        "she'll never learn english if you speak your language with her."<br>
        language is central to appearing culturally compatible, and therefore quasi-assimilable<br>
        <span style="padding-left:30px;"></span>with whiteness.<br>
        despite, or because of, life under sinhala buddhist nationalism in sri lanka &mdash;<br>
        where language identifies ethnicity, religion, and presumed politics,<br>

        my parents speak tamil to each other, but teach me to respond in english.<br>
        <span style="padding-left:30px;"></span>and so<br>
        the oppressors have yet to catch me with a tamil tongue.<br>
        <p>the u.s. has a culture of mocking multilingualism, but<br>
        we tamils are one of the oldest extant ethnolinguistic groups in the archaeological record,<br>

        in 1981 when sri lankan security forces and sinhalese mobs set fire to the jaffna public library.<br>

        oral transmission through memorization and recitation is not strange to me<br>
        as it is to my classmates. neither is the concept<br>
        of self-immolation.</p>
        <p>these rules of engagement are not unlike the practices of colonization.<br>

        <p>the island that tamils call <i><span lang="ta">eelam</span></i> was partially colonized by the portuguese and then the dutch in the 16th century, and then<br>
        the english set out to colonize the entire island in 1815, establishing english as the language of the government<br>
        <span style="padding-left:30px;"></span>of british ceylon<br>
        and the medium of instruction in 1833, along with a centralization of power<br>

            postcolonial sri lankan governance emphasizes <em>sri lankan</em> as a culturally unifying identity: the project of a sinhala-buddhist nation-state whose cartography does not coincide with sri lanka's ethnic-cultural-religious maps, whose boundaries are drawn to erase other natives. indigeneity is coopted and politicized. those deemed nonindigenous, even falsely, must hide, flee, or pass.

        after ceylon gained its independence in 1948 and renamed itself <i>sri lanka</i>,<br>

      <h2 class="my-4">decolonial thought</h2>
        <p>as an epistemic endeavor, decoloniality emerged<br>
        from the work of scholars from south and latin america<br>
        referencing a period of colonial conquest from the 15th century on.<br>
        as a political project, it originates in indigenous resistance to the colonial matrix of power,<br>
        which predates the "decolonial turn" of theory<br>
        and its recent popularization as an academic buzzword.<br>
          <span class="aside">
            indigenous knowledge in batticaloa spans farming, fishing, ayurveda and <span lang="ta">siddha</span> medicine, singing, handloom weaving, cane working, goldsmithing, nature-friendly techniques for extending the shelf-life of foods like paneer, and <span lang="ta">vedda</span> knowledges (ramanan, 2015, pp. 2-5). ayurveda and <span lang="ta">siddha</span> physicians could identify a species of snake by administering herbal concoctions and evaluating a snake-bitten patient's sense of taste. ancient batticaloa was famous for its sorcery, thought to consist of defensive and curative magic. batticaloa tamil is a "pure" tamil with links to ancient tamil literature. religious festivals retain something of this with <span lang="ta">koothu</span>, folkdance, <span lang="ta">kaavadi</span> (<a href="misability/body-mod.html" target="_blank">piercing</a> the skin with spikes), and fire-walking. <span lang="ta">paatta</span>, my maternal grandfather, did <span lang="ta">kaavadi</span>; my maternal great-grandmother fire-walked. these practices have become rare or extremely localized.
          </span>
        decolonial movements express the desire for land rematriation, for reparations<br>
        to indigenous communities harmed by settler colonial violence,<br>
        and for decolonizing knowledges, languages, categories of thought, belief systems,<br>
        <span style="padding-left:30px;"></span>and subjectivity<br>
        disrupted by imperial conquest. colonization has permanently disrupted<br>
        indigenous/precolonial ways of knowing (lugones, 2010).<br>
        sri lanka is <i>postcolonial</i>, but all that means<br>
        is that the colonizers physically withdrew, having<br>
        irrevocably changed the cultures they touched: conferring legitimacy<br>
        on western medicine, western scientific inquiry, the hegemony of vision<br>
        and empirical exactitude <span style="padding-left:40px;"></span> delegitimizing<br>
        storytelling, intentional ambiguity, traditional medicine, the nobility<br>
        <span style="padding-left:30px;"></span>of sound and touch.<br>
        <p>modernity and coloniality are inseparable, <i>modernity</i> being imbricated in<br>
        <span style="padding-left:30px;"></span>european colonial domination (quijano, 2007). 
        "modernity/coloniality," as quijano calls it, functions to negate <span style="padding-left:20px;"></span> distort <span style="padding-left:30px;"></span> deny<br>
        alternate subjectivities, knowledges, and phenomenological understandings.<br>
        lugones (2010) describes coloniality/modernity as the operation of Eurocentric ontological organization,<br>
        a consolidation of power through atomic, homogeneous categories<br>
        that fractured precolonial social patterns and perceptions of race, gender relations, sexual politics,<br>
        <span style="padding-left:30px;"></span> cosmology.<br>
        for lugones and mignolo (2005, 2011), decoloniality spurs us towards a new geopolitics of knowledge,<br>
        one that is historically and geographically specific, that resists how the<br>
        <p style="padding-left:30px; line-height: 1.25em;">
        "west was, and still is, the only geo-historical location that is both part of the classification of the world, and the only perspective that has the privilege of possessing 
        dominant categories of thoughts from which and where the rest of the world can be described, classified, understood, and improved" (mignolo, 2005, p. 36).</p>
          <span class="aside">
            i adopted my parents' tamil habits: pacing and memorizing my textbooks by whispering a section aloud multiple times consecutively, fixing it in my memory before moving on to the next. memorization precedes the ability to interrogate and build on a text. in my ph.d. program, slowed by fibromyalgia and medication, i found my classes moved too quickly &mdash; and my mind too slowly &mdash; for me to memorize-to-comprehend derrida or gramsci before speaking up in class. 
          </span>
        modernity/coloniality establishes itself, and thus eurocentrism, as the blueprint of<br>
        <span style="padding-left:30px;"></span> civilization; everything else, like <span lang="ta">eelam</span>,<br>
        is <em>developing</em>, which disparages precolonial epistemological and ontological<br>
        orientations<br>
        to gender <span style="padding-left:30px;"></span> sexuality <span style="padding-left:30px;"></span> disability <span style="padding-left:30px;"></span>  medicine <span style="padding-left:30px;"></span>  scholarship.<br>
        decoloniality seeks to open "the doors<br>
        to another thinking," "doors that lead<br>
        to other types of truths whose basis is not being but the coloniality of being,<br>
        the colonial wound" (mignolo, 2011, p. 48).</p>
        <p>for me, this <i>other thinking</i> is how tamil knowledge manifests in rote learning,<br>
        nested stories, parables, meditation practices, community engagement,<br>
        care work; how writing and illness are described in cultural idiom that is bodyminded and<br>
        as linked to nature as local knowledges<br>
        in agricultural batticaloa.</p>
        <p>intellectual colonization remains intact as long as it reproduces the cultures of scholarship<br>
        <span style="padding-left:30px;"></span>endeared to the colonial matrix of power.<br>
        how important it is that we revise our ideas of mastery<br>
        and the languages we use to describe it (singh, 2018).</p><br>
        <p>neither a turn nor a field, decolonial thought materializes<br>
        whenever/wherever modernity/coloniality appears,<br>
          <span style="padding-left:30px;"></span>interrogating its tight coupling, seeking to make sense of it<br>
        and to resist. 
          <span class="aside" style="padding-left:30px; line-height: 1.25em;">
            decolonization is not a metaphor. when metaphor invades decolonization, it kills the very possibility of decolonization; it recenters whiteness, it resettles theory, it extends innocence to the settler, it entertains a settler future. decolonize (a verb) and decolonization (a noun) cannot easily be grafted onto pre-existing discourses/frameworks, even if they are critical, even if they are anti-racist, even if they are justice frameworks. the easy absorption, adoption, and transposing of decolonization is yet another form of settler appropriation. when we write about decolonization, we are not offering it as a metaphor; it is not an approximation of other experiences of oppression. decolonization is not a swappable term for other things we want to do to improve our societies and schools. decolonization doesn't have a synonym.

        i think of our protests &mdash; rallies by families of the disappeared,<br>
        tamil diaspora marches with support from indigenous allies (jeyapal, 2016, p. 60).<br>
        for me, the goals are two currents in a single river:<br>
        land returned to eelam tamils in sri lanka<br>
        displaced by wartime violence or government seizure of their ancestral homes,<br>
        and similar sovereignty for indigenous peoples in the u.s.,<br>
        whose lands i and my nuclear family occupy; and<br>
        dismantling the modern/colonial lenses that have compressed<br>
        precolonially capacious, fluid categories of queerness, gender, disability, kinship,<br>
        medical practice, the human sensorium,<br>
        temporality, chronicity, death, renewal.</p>
        <p>"epistemological decolonization is needed to clear the way for new intercultural<br>
        communication" (quijano, 2007, p. 177), the kind that does not submit to the terms<br>
        of global imperial politics and economy but<br>
        ascribes to another thinking and<br>
        the possibility of another world. pluri-versal (not uni-versal), it challenges the notion<br>
        that the local histories and epistemologies of european colonizers<br>
        are absolutes to which the colonized must bend. it permits an escape<br>
        from the trap of postmodernity/postcoloniality<br>
        whose interpretations and critiques remain susceptible to "the tendency<br>
        to accept thinking that is constructed by european history and that experience<br>
        is de-localized" (mignolo, 2011, p. 52). in learning to relinquish mastery<br>
        we find ourselves trained in logics of domination (singh, 2018, p. 172).<br>

        as objects of study, not ways of knowing<br>

        a careless anticolonial rejection of this framing
        risks reinscribing mastery<br>
        by centering new masterful subjects still critically tied<br>
        to coloniality (singh, 2018, pp. 1-3).</p><br>
        <p>you can't distance yourself from mastery in writing a dissertation.<br> mastering the discipline &mdash; as <i>mastery</i> is understood by one's committee members &mdash;<br>
        <span style="padding-left:30px;"></span>is the whole point.<br>
        it feels risky to say that in form and content, this dissertation aims to reintroduce</p>
        <p style="padding-left:30px; line-height: 1.25em;">languages, memories, economies, social organizations, and at least double subjectivities . . . the indelible footprint of what existed that has been converted into the colonial wound; in the degradation of humanity, in the inferiority of the pagans, the primitives, the under-developed, the non-democratic (mignolo, 2011, p. 63)</p>
        <p>in the context of western biomedical capture, the violence of cure,<br>

            "images help stabilize and anchor collective memory's transient and fluctuating nature in art, cinema, television, and photography, aiding recall to the extent that images often become an event's primary markers" (zelizer, 2000, p. 6). but the u.s. media largely ignored sri lanka's ethnic conflict until its endgame in 2009. without visual evidence around which the narrativization of collective memory could revolve, the generation of postmemory in my sister and i occurred almost solely through my parents' transmissions. hirsch (2012) defines postmemory as "<em>not</em> an <em>identity</em> position but a <em>generational</em> structure of transmission embedded in multiple forms of mediation" (p. 35). every ambiguous story i am told is a nonverbal, precognitive act of familial memory transfer, transposing me into the traumatic past. white van abductions. narrowly avoided landmines. ever-shifting numbers of soldiers and corpses. everyone in power a liar. pain so ordinary, it's better to just deal.

        <p>hall (1990) says that diasporas generally strive to preserve their culture as they<br>

        while adapting it to suit the needs of their new home. he says:</p>        
        <p style="padding-left:30px; line-height: 1.25em;">the diaspora experience as i intend it here is defined, not by essence or purity, but by the recognition of a necessary heterogeneity and diversity; by a conception of 'identity' which lives with and through, not despite, difference; by <i>hybridity</i>. diaspora identities are those which are constantly producing and reproducing themselves anew, through transformation and difference. (p. 235)</p>
        <p>within concrete communities in the eelam tamil diaspora,<br>
        within the eelam tamil diasporic imaginary,<br>
        the nuclear family surfaces as a discrete unit with its own idiosyncrasies,<br>
        singular experiences and traumas, modes of transmission, and teller and receiver roles<br>
        in a specifically familial generation of postmemory (hirsch, 2012, pp. 34-35).<br>
        different families, of course, tell different stories about the war<br>
        and tell them differently. i wouldn't really know for myself.<br>
        the vagaries of academic employment ensured our separation<br>
        from tamil diaspora communities as <span lang="ta">appa</span> chased tenure.<br>
        memory is "shaped by social and cultural context<br>
        and collective memories are formed, made coherent and narrativized<br>
        through group commemorative practices and institutions<br>
        such as the media and museums" (seoighe, 2021, p. 173), but<br>  
        we were our own memory community, a far-flung star<br>

            cronin-furman (2018) on the state-sanctioned policing of memory by (sinhalese) victors who overwhelmingly defeated their (tamil) opponents:
            <p style="line-height: 1.25em;">in the immediate aftermath of atrocities, questions about memory are questions about relationships between the state and its subjects. it is the state that allows some to commemorate publicly and forces others to light candles alone at home. and it's the state that designates some bodies as vessels for memory and leaves others in unmarked graves. in this context, forgetting is not 'letting go of the past'; it's a process of erasure. it is the state that decides what may be remembered and what must be forgotten. (paras. 31-32).</p>
            storying on the part of my parents, and composite narrative on mine, is the only available antidote, but sometimes i listen to my sister skillfully rattle off the names, dates, casualty numbers, social and legal terms around the tamil genocide, and nevermind that it's her profession, it makes me compare my cognitive dysfunction to spain's <i><span lang="es">pacto del olvido</span></i> (pact of forgetting), fms/me like a francoist tyrant imposing enforced forgetfulness on the body in a misguided attempt to give it peace.</p>

        the need to communicate ancestral memory and family lore<br>
        outweighed the imbalance between the capacities of adults and children,<br>
        the danger of affective contagion,<br>
        the potentially fatal possibility that the writer in the family &mdash; me &mdash;<br>
        <span style="padding-left:30px;"></span> might one day tell all.</p>
        <p>collective memory spans the universal/general and familial/specific
        mediating the narrative of the postgeneration (hirsch, 2012). <span lang="ta">appa and amma</span><br>
        transmitted their stories to us with incautious urgency, animatedly,<br>
        mixing english and tamil, immediacy enhanced<br>
        by use of the second-person and a resonant familial/cultural aesthetics of experience (hirsch 2012; desjarlais, 1992).<br>
        zelizer (2000) notes,<br>
        "everyone participates in the production of memory, though not equally" (p. 4).<br>
        i participated first as a listener, pressing for details, asking<br>
        to hear stories over and over to fix them in my mind, and then &mdash;<br>
        to my parents' chagrin, as a writer &mdash;<br>
        with a penchant for interweaving their stories with my own,<br>
        using my experiences to make sense of theirs, or theirs to illuminate mine.<br>
        crafting an approximation of memory with the psychic, affective force<br>
        of the original telling (hirsch, 2012, p. 31):</p>
        <p style="padding-left:30px; line-height: 1.25em;">second-generation fiction, art, memoir, and testimony are shaped by the attempt to represent the long-term effects of living in close proximity to the pain, depression, and dissociation of persons who have witnessed and survived massive historical trauma. they are shaped by the child's confusion and responsibility, by a desire to repair, and by the consciousness that her own existence may well be a form of compensation for unspeakable loss. loss of family, home, of a sense of belonging and safety in the world "bleed" from one generation to the next. (p. 34)</p>
        <p>so it is with my understandings of pain, disability, temporality, and epistemic certainty.<br>
        at 11 i wrote my first book, a failed fantasy novel whose characters<br>

        death by fire, suicide bombing, and disappearance are my go-to conceits.<br>
        in retrospect, i see how every story i tell &mdash; including this one &mdash; is a subconscious act of<br>
        <span style="padding-left:30px;"></span> historical and cultural preservation,<br>
        the preservation of a familial generational identity with few photographs<br>

        <p>there is a south asian proverb: "the gods hate what is obvious; the gods love what is obscure" (trawick, 1990, p. 37).<br>
        trawick notes that western observers report<br>
        that south asians offer multiple interpretations of daily events,<br>
        apply and reapply varying behavioral standards contextually,<br>
        avoid absolutes even in answering simple questions, accept contradictions without<br>
        <span style="padding-left:30px;"></span> attempting to reconcile them (p. 40).<br>
        she says:</p>
        <p style="padding-left:30px; line-height: 1.25em;">intentional ambiguity, of the indian variety, is more than just anomaly or unclassifiable otherness, more than something outside the structure that has somehow to be dealt with, more than just an ad hoc way of getting from one category to another, and more than the kind of once-a-year chaos that is needed to keep some orders well-defined. intentional ambiguity is not interstitial ambiguity, marginal, liminal ambiguity characteristic of what is dismaying or strange to people, but ambiguity is at the heart of things, openly embraced where it is found, emphasized where it is hard to perceive, and created where it could not otherwise exist. (p. 42)</p>
        <p>as meaning accrues, the importance lies less in signifier/signified<br>
        than in the relationship across many signifieds, and<br>
        the objective is not necessarily consensus or consistency.<br>
        appuhamilage (2017) describes indian personhood as dividual in<br>
        <span style="padding-left:30px;"></span> nature, fluid and open, and<br>
        profoundly embodied, made up of "substance-codes" &mdash; like blood, food, knowledge &mdash; that<br>

        unlike the colonial, "rational" western autonomous self,<br>
        tamil personhood is recognized, like the body, as a thing in constant flux, defined by dynamic intersubjective<br>
        relations with people <span style="padding-left:15px;"></span> places <span style="padding-left:15px;"></span> and things (p. 6).<br>
        euro-western epistemologies are deeply rooted in monosemy, whereas tamil ways of<br>
        <span style="padding-left:30px;"></span> knowing and giving form to knowledge<br>
        are polysemous, multiply signifying, full of discrepancies, hidden metaphors, wordplay,<br>

        writing obliquely and metaphorically about an incurable condition i don't want to fully cure<br>
        makes visible precolonial forms of knowledge, where a singular utterance<br>
        conceals a multiplicity of meanings and motivations, contradictions and self-negations.<br>
        so many modern euro-western epistemologies adore and require agonism and proof,<br>
        favor precision over indefinite conclusions, straight lines over crooked paths,<br>
        directness and swiftness,<br>
        singularities over multitudes, empiricism over stories.<br>
        decolonial thought is a framework that is neither frame nor work (cole, 2002, p. 458).<br>
        it is here to explain to the proof-seekers in the <span lang="grc">agon</span><br>
        how truths are presented in the form of stories, even when,<br>
        especially when, they are ambiguous or concealed,<br>
        that the truly enlightened are the ones down for decoding.<br>
        decolonial thought lets me lay<br>
        the lost identities of colonized people<br>
        over western criteria for sickness and intellectual prowess,<br>
        countering hegemonic knowledge systems, making room<br>
        for the knowledges of marginalized people.</p><br>
        <p>ancestral memory, ontology, epistemology informed my understandings of self, pain,<br>
        positionality in the clinic and academy. in the clinical setting,<br>
        <i>intergenerational trauma</i> makes everything <i>psychosomatic</i>. to some,<br>
        this writing makes my whole project suspect. but<br>
        it's truer to my subject and heritage than traditional forms of scholarship.<br>

        <span style="padding-left:30px;"></span> colonialism &mdash;<br>
        living and working on appropriated land, where indigenous populations are segregated or regularly subject to violence (jeyapal, 2016, p. 59).<br>
        thiyagarajah (2015) writes,</p>
        <p style="padding-left:30px; line-height: 1.25em;">there is privilege in being here, in not really knowing motherland. indeed, perhaps that is the saddest part. being displaced grants us some semblance of safety, while permanently rupturing us from our roots. still, we continue working and sewing [sic] new seeds where possible. (p. 35)</p>
        for tamils, one's ancestral homeland is considered a substance in the blood<br>
        most compatible with your being (Daniel, 1984, p. 9), but<br>
        i &mdash; and many in the tamil diaspora &mdash; can't or don't want to<br>
        return to sri lanka, even as we advocate for justice and self-determination<br>
        for tamils back home.</p>
        <p>the central question of research is always <i>who and what<br> 
        does my research serve?</i><br>
        but this dissertation does not <span style="padding-left:15px;"></span> cannot <span style="padding-left:30px;"></span> express the needs or wants<br>
        of tamils in sri lanka, or of diasporic tamils in canada, the u.k., australia, or elsewhere.<br>
        in sri lanka, tamils in tamil eelam live with oppression,<br>
        from the legacy of euro-western colonialism to sinhalese military occupation, camps for internally displaced people,<br>
        <span style="padding-left:30px;"></span> resettlement.<br>
        i write this never having worried about where i would run<br>
        if the sky was full of threat.<br>
        eelam tamils in the north and east, and those forcibly displaced<br>
        by sinhalese incursion, and those<br>
        who bore witness and fled, and those<br>
        disabled by war<br>
        live with conditions i don't, however much<br>
        chronic painervation and precarity affect me.</p>
        <p>my counterstories and tactics,<br>
        and the epistemologies and ontologies of pain i emphasize in the telling,<br>
        may be taken up by anyone with chronic pain, traditional knowledges,<br>
        sensory heritages, postmemory<br>
        that inform interpretations of pain but result in medical gaslighting.<br>
        that said,<br>
        i write with my people in mind &mdash; chronically ill eelam tamil americans and<br>
        tamil refugees and expats &mdash; and more broadly<br>
        other south and southeast asians<br>
        who are regularly denied their epistemologies<br>
        who are told the secret of success is model minority assimilation<br>
        who face implicit bias in healthcare<br>
        and lifelong racial discrimination that can contribute to lifelong pain (aroke et al., 2019).</p><br>

            colorism in south asia stems from colonialism. many of our ancient venerated avatars and heroes &mdash; like krishna, rama, ravana, as well as beautiful women like <span lang="sa">draupadi</span> &mdash; had dark complexions. colonization and postcolonial media have ingrained fairness as the feminine ideal of beauty. i was the darker daughter, so <span lang="ta">amma</span> pushed lightening creams at me "to make me fair." i hated it, hated that i reflexively understood it as both cosmetic practice and survival tactic. that is, the fairer a woman is, the more marriageable she is in sri lanka, and the more likely she is to retain her model minority status in white, white-biased america.
