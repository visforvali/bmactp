      <p><b>Anji Manivannan</b> is an Eelam Tamil American human rights lawyer who holds a J.D. from New York University School of Law and a B.S. in Physics from the University of Virginia. As a human rights lawyer, Anji has worked at local organizations in India, Palestine, and West Africa as well as New York-based human rights and transitional justice international non-governmental organizations. She currently leads <a href="https://pearlaction.org/" target="_blank">PEARL</a>'s international justice and genocide recognition efforts as the Legal Director, and has expertise in atrocity crimes, transitional justice, gender, and freedom of expression. She contributed to this project as a storyteller, knitter, fact-checker, and editor.</p>

As a writer, she has been published by <i>Joyland</i>, <i>Midwestern Gothic</i>, <i>Underground Voices</i>, <i>Palooka</i>, and <i>The Best American Poetry Blog</i>.

      <p><b>Sara Fuller</b> grew up in southeast South Dakota where she first began painting and photographing.

She has worked as a Pilates instructor in the area of pain management and postural awareness for over 10 years. In this capacity, she has delved into embodied anatomy, muscular imbalances, and functional movement. For Sara, Pilates has been the most effective means of survival/therapy since her eventual diagnosis with fibromyalgia in 2014, which followed body temperature dysregulation and medical mysteries, starting with a head injury in middle school and other sports-related injuries in high school. She lives with her partner Mary in Brooklyn, where she continues to photograph, paint, and study the body. Sara contributed to this project as a visual artist and as Vyshali's bodyworker for over a decade.</p>
