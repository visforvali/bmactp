    <section>
      <p>This dissertation has an ensemble cast of composite and real characters. As a literary and autoethnographic device, I have named and described the primary characters here (Ellis, 2004, 2018; Forber-Pratt, 2015). Composite characters combine actual persons and events to create exemplar cases, a common practice in autoethnographic and healthcare research. They are categorized by relationship to me and professional occupation.</p>

Eelam Tamils from Batticaloa, Sri Lanka, they came to the U.S. for <span lang="ta">APPA's</span> doctorate in Physics before the anti-Tamil Black July massacres in Sri Lanka, which prevented them from returning home.

              A queer white woman in her early forties who met VYSHALI in Columbia's M.F.A. program in 2005, before VYSHALI was disabled. Living with pain herself, MARY was instrumental in VYSHALI's formation of a disability identity and a relatively painless wardrobe. She is also VYSHALI's literary agent and a key contributor to all of her writing projects. Along with her longtime partner SARA, she helped care for VYSHALI at several points during her illness.

PANCHALI is a composite character combining several ableist academic figures of multiple races and ranks who dismissed or minimized VYSHALI's disability and/or refused to accommodate her.
